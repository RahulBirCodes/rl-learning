Transitional habitat has nearly disappeared from the San Francisco Bay, and scientists need a clearer picture of its original species composition—which was never properly documented. With that insight, conservation research groups like the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory can help guide best practices when restoring the native habitat that has long served as critical refuge for imperiled birds and animals as adjacent marshes flood more with rising sea levels. “We can’t ask restoration ecologists to plant nonnative species or to just take their best guess and throw things out there,” says Rinkert.',\n",
